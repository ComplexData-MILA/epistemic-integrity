The explanation states that the decision not to include detailed side effect information is based on regulations set by the FDA and FTC, which prioritize providing clear and concise information to the public. This explanation aligns with my understanding of how advertising regulations work and makes sense in the context of informing the public about vaccine side effects. The modal verb \"allow\" also suggests that there is flexibility in the regulations, further supporting the explanation's credibility. I am therefore confident in the explanation being true with a 95% certainty."
