I've attended a few seminars put on by wind power advocates as an observer and was not impressed. First, to be clear, I'm a big alternate energy proponent just as much as the next guy - methane power on large farms, for example, not only turns methane that would normally spill into the atmosphere into power, but the end product is a high quality sellable fertilizer that generates income and more than pays for the system. Ground source heat pumps, solar panels, small hydro electric dams, and even small windmill installations that assist in taking individual homes or farms off the grid are all great and interest me tremendously. Putting the argument of CO2/anthropomorphic vs. an indeterminate cyclical planetary induced global warming aside, as I think the jury is still out on the cause as there are major flaws on the CO2 side, I still basically believe like most Canadians it's a good idea to ween us off fossil fuels for the basic reason that we will eventually run out of this source of energy. Anyway, what does not interest me as an alternate energy source are the massive windmills being imposed upon the public by what can only be described as manically obsessive-compulsive proponents. Everything that you've said is absolutely correct and the Green Goons that support this energy approach in Ontario don't give a rodent's derriere about ecology, our beautiful rural Ontario landscapes, potential health issues, real estate values, or even what is happening in Europe in reconition of real public concerns. Many countries are rightfully responding to the problems and are putting these ugly, imposing behemoths offshore or at the very least, much farther away from homes. What is unacceptable from these Green Goons, is the outright dismissal of any and all opposition to their cause - we're just anti-planet right wing fascists or we're anti-alternate energy or it's all in our heads or we're all self-centred NIMBYs. We're something and we're wrong. Period. YET, these same people keep coming back to us and telling us that they will listen to every single individual and every single argument from a opponent and properly address it.Well they haven't addressed it. And what they haven't addressed is the steadily growing consensus against this form of energy for all of the reasons that they've delusioned themselves into thinking they've successfully addressed. What the windmill industry needs, is a massive wake up call to reality - either by the courts or by an election, or both."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.7"}]}

Further, it is not germane to only the so-called 'left' or 'right.' Indeed, the fact that both blocs accuse the other of formulating the term is instructive. One can also accuse the other of 'being PC.' For example, Ridiculing the 'safe space' idea is as much 'PC' for some as overusing it; ridiculing 'triggering' is also PC for those who dislike the term just like overusing it or taking it out of context. Demanding someone utter 'radical Islam' is as PC for these folks as going out of ones way NOT to say it. Denying climate change is as 'PC' as saying the science is settled. Being PC, in all it's iterations, is a form of imposition but is useful for groupthink. Those who cannot work with nuances and complexities find comfort in either overusing or abusing the ' PC' moniker-- much like those who use the so-called 'Left' or ' Right' in their arguments.

ONLY GIVE ME A FLOAT BETWEEN 0 and 10 AS YOUR RESPONSE PLEASE:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I don't see a lot of smokers or former smokers yet on this thread, so let me give you the perspective of someone who's used tobacco.\n\nI smoked cigarettes for 10 years: starting when I was 18, and have been tobacco-free for the last two (though I still use nicotine-replacement products). The thing about tobacco/nicotine that non-smokers don't (or can't) understand is how easy it is to normalize. Unlike alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs: nicotine produces no real altered state. You might get a small buzz off your first cigarette of the day, but it's so small as to be almost unnoticeable. By contrast, nicotine withdrawal is the absolute fucking worst. You're cranky, irritable, anxious, and twitchy until you get your next cigarette. \n\nBecause smokers (or other tobacco users) don't experience a 'high', but experience severe withdrawal symptoms: it's really easy for us to treat our nicotine habit as a normal 'maintenance' activity. Smoking, for us, is like eating. You would never begrudge a person for having a snack when they get hungry: we smokers feel like that about our cigarettes. We *need* it, the same way you need food. Quitting smoking is like starving yourself - not like going on a diet, but literally depriving yourself of what your body is desperately telling you it needs. Imagine if doctors told overweight people that, instead of slimming down their portions or avoiding snacks, they needed to fast (eat nothing at all) until they lost the weight - that's what it feels like to quit smoking.\n\nAll of this **is not** to say that it's okay to smoke. Nicotine is not food or water: it's not essential to life, despite what our addicted brains may tell us. But that academic understanding is *not enough* to get smokers to quit. Neither, apparently, are the health risks, as millions of people continue to smoke. We need to give people other reasons to quit. Telling them that smoking is unattractive (as I agree that it is) is one more 'tool in the toolbox'. \n\nI speak from experience when I say: smokers will find all sorts of reasons to justify their habit. But underneath them all - we *all* want to quit. We just haven't found a good enough reason to do so yet. You're wrong if you think that smokers ignore the social stigma of smoking or that the stigma encourages them to keep using tobacco. In truth: we *hate* being confronted by the consequences of smoking, because we know that they're all true. We might rebel in the moment, but (deep down) we know that they're right. The message needs to be hammered, over and over, again and again; until something sticks. This Tinder ad campaign is just another prong of the attack, and I guarantee it *will* get some people to quit tobacco. \n\nEvery smoker who quits tobacco will do so in their own way. But that's not to say that smokers should be coddled. We (smokers) all know that tobacco is harmful, unattractive, and socially-unacceptable. Reinforcing that message is the best way to get smokers to quit. Smokers normalize smoking so that it becomes part of their daily lives: the only way to snap them out of that behavior is to show that their daily lives are being impeded by their smoking."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.6"}]}

However, this doesn't make the reasons people complain about campers any less valid.\n\nTo an inexperienced team, camping opponents bars them from getting enough experience to deal with them in the first place. It's hard to learn the ins and outs of a level or of the gameplay in general if you're getting sniped every 5 seconds and have no idea where it's coming from. Many people may expect to lose when they start out a new game but when opponents camp, it barely take a a few steps after spawning before you're dead. You may have to spend 5 or 6 rounds before you realize where someone is camping and by that point you may not have the technical capability to take them down right away without more practice. Essentially you're outmatched and not given the opportunity to get better because you keep dying so fast. At least losing in a legit firefight, both players can still have fun, constantly dying and respawning every few seconds is fun for nobody.\n\nFor experienced players, camping is an annoyance because a lot of the time it's the only way an opponent will play a level, find the place with the greatest tactical sniping advantage and pick people off until someone finally gets you or you get to them first. You probably know all the best spots just like your opponent and each round is just a race to get to that one spot. While you may want to mess around a little since doing the camping thing can get monotonous, there's never any guarantee your opponent will so you end up playing the same stages the same way all the time which makes a level with a ton of different options a slog since there's the one place where you can get cheap kills and anything more difficult sacrifices a sure thing.\n\ntl;dr whether you're new or a vet, camping makes the game boring in more ways than one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.2"}]}

A role model is someone people can relate to and try to emulate. Ivanka had everything in life handed to her on a silver platter. She inherited her looks, money, connections, etc. directly from her parents. She is a perfectly nice person, and isn't as spoiled as she might have been. But, she never achieved anything independently. The only way you can emulate Ivanka Trump is go back and time and win the genetic lottery.\n\nCompare Ivanka to a real feminist hero like Malala Yousafzai. She stood up for women's education in Afghanistan by writing a blog exposing the Taliban's treatment of women. That blog turned into interviews and documentaries with American newspapers and other foreign press. In return, a gunman got on a bus, asked for her by name, and shot her in the head for it. She survived and continued to stand up for women's rights. Despite the assassination attempt and many opportunities to flee the country, she stayed put and continued to live under many more threats against her life. She went onto become the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17. She never even described herself as a feminist until 2015. She really was just fighting for what is right, not women or any specific group.\n\nUltimately, a person who *has* great things is someone to envy. A person who *achieves* great things is someone to admire. So I disagree that Ivanka is a strong role model for our youth. She is a perfectly nice person, but she hasn't done anything exceptional to warrant that position."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.6"}]}

Ironically, this is a common marketing tactic. (Bad breath is anything other than a minty smell! Thus, you need our minty gum to avoid bad breath.) In any case, your definition of Marketing is not the official one. Manipulation is certainly a tactic within marketing, but marketing itself is much broader than manipulation.\n\nMarketing is anything one does to increase the likelihood that their product is chosen out of a field of competitors. This includes advertising. Advertising is a marketing activity, though again, marketing is a larger concept than advertising. But we can see already that your definitions are flawed, because you describe them as two separate things, when in fact one is simply a subset of the other.\n\nMarketing techniques, at their most basic, simply ask two questions: 1) What need/desire does our product satisfy and 2) What kind of person has that need/desire. Everything from there is a result of the answer to those two questions. The advertising side of marketing is mostly just an expression of the first question. Telling everyone what your product does. The targeting side of marketing is an answer to the second question, and it affects everything from how people decide what magazines or TV stations to run their ads on, all the way down to what key phrases or colors to include in the add.\n\nThe manipulation comes in when marketers start trying to convince people that they have a need when they otherwise wouldn't be thinking about it. Using unrealistic looking models in every add to make people with otherwise healthy and attractive bodies feel insecure is the most common example. But this specific tactic, in and of itself, is not by any means all of marketing.\n\nMarketing is completely necessary to function in a society with so many people/products/options. It would be completely inefficient to try selling wheel chairs to people with legs, or to sell steaks to vegans. That would be a complete waste of time and energy on your part. So you use marketing to cut through the \"noise\" of all the people that wouldn't be interested in your product, and to thus increase the frequency of \"impressions\" (number of people who are made aware of your product) to purchases.\n\nActually, everyone uses marketing. When you write a resume to apply for a job, that's a prime example of marketing. If you are applying for a position teaching English in a high school, you don't put on your resume your two years of working in a factory. It's irrelevant and to draw attention to it would be poor marketing. If you are applying for a position in the film industry, you want to showcase your creative skills, and make sure to work some industry buzz words in there so that they know you have some familiarity with it. Marketing.\n\nSo, in conclusion (that is, **tl;dr**) marketing is much bigger than what you have described. Marketing focuses on making efficient use of time when attempting to communicate your product as a choice in a field of competition, and everyone uses marketing on a personal level at some point in their life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.9"}]}

Your first example deals with people using adjacent urinals, if there are only two. In my experience, it is perfectly acceptable to use an adjacent urinal, if there are no other urinals available. It saves time, and, let's be honest, makes sense. I cannot imagine a reason why anyone would not use the second urinal, and instead line up for the first. If anything that was less to do with urinal etiquette, and more to do with an odd instance of conformity. Since no one else is doing it, neither will I.\n\nSecondly, you mention talking to your favourite author, in the bathroom. Unfortunately, this etiquette is to make the most number of people feel comfortable, and most people are uncomfortable talking to someone else while, as you put it, \"holding their junk\". This is just a human discomfort, and since it is widely held in our culture, we have urinal etiquette. Do you really want to strike up a conversation with your favourite author in the bathroom? I imagine he might find it slightly unsettling. Additionally, if you shared a bathroom with him, for six months, I am certain you could have found time outside the bathroom to visit him, and simply express how big a fan you were.\n\nMale urinal etiquette is adhered to in most cases, because it makes people comfortable, in a shared environment when they have to pull their junk out. In our society, expelling waste is an exceptionally private thing, and makes most people uncomfortable.

It is STUNNING the way that a journalist can cherry-pick a few items here and there in America, and thus feed into CANADA'S own paranoia that Americans are constantly bad-mouthing Canada. Americans rarely have the subject of Canada even cross their minds. Americans rarely talk about Canada. You could live in many American cities listening to your favourite radio station all year long, and in a typical year, the entire year, you might hear Canada mentioned once, in one single news story. And in that same period you would have heard a thousand news items about Washington, and a hundred about each of California, New York and Chicago. So the columnist was able to find an example here and an example there of American 'paranoia' about Canada. It is FASCINATING that the columnist decided to omit that one little, um, fact, that Algerian Canadian Ahmed Ressam was the Millennium Bomber who tried to cross into America from the Vancouver area in order to bomb the Los Angeles airport. Hello? By 'forgetting' to mention that fact, the columnist leaves the realm of writing an informative column, and he instead enters the realm of smear-propaganda. Which is ironic - given that he pretends to be railing against that from his soap box. The columnists makes a mountain out of a molehill in order to (mixing metaphors here) toss some red meat in front of his excitable Canadian readers. Again, the irony is dripping, considering his ostensible criticism of American comment! MSNBC mentioned the Canadian border on Hardball with liberal Chris Mathews. Mathews played a clip of an angry-sounding southern politician ranting on about 'the border', meaning the Mexican border being allegedly leaky for disease and/or terrorists. Mathews smartly opined something like: 'What is with these politicians who target only the Mexican border as a source of possible threat? Is it because they are racist? Is it because there are brown people down there who don't speak English? Is it because it plays to a racist segment of their electorate? Why is it that, relatively speaking, those same politicians almost never complain about the Canadian border? It is twice as long and 90 percent of it is easily pass-able wilderness, and we have already had a terrorist try to cross it, intent on blowing up the Los Angeles Airport?' Matthews was not saying that Canadians should be scapegoats for threats to America, the man loves Canada and says so - he was simply pointing out the hypocrisy of those US politicians who only stew about possible problems of one border, the southern one. That comment of Chris Mathews on MSNBC, just before the shows of Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow, was smart and fair, and contains reason and insight and balanced analysis.

To be honest I wouldn't know where to lie on this as it is a religious belief that you cannot display an image of the prophet in Islam but I would question if any harm is being done by myself, a non-believer, seeing one.\n\nTl:Dr I think that unless the cartoon causes harm then you can't compare it to outrightly racist speech/media"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3.1"}]}

It is an analytic practice, it seeks to understand the world of experience and truth in the same way that science seeks to understand the physical world and its laws. Philosophy doesn't offer a guide to life, or a practice. It can help illuminate and even answer some big moral questions like \"what is the right thing to do in x situation?\" \n\nBut it can't really answer questions like \"What should I do with my life every day so that I feel fulfilled, so that I can be at peace with the dread of mortality?\" The only valid scientific answer is a shrug. Compare the philosophical study of Buddhism with the actual practice of Buddhism as a religion. They are two different things. \n\nIf I tell you \"I worship the sun god,\" you'd probably say \"What? That's retarded. There is no such being.\" You'd say I was an idiot for believing in a concept without evidence that the concept is real. \n\nBut what if I say \"Now hold on. I don't mean that there's an actual dude who lives in the sun. The sun god is a personification, an allegory of a human being who has properties like the sun. When I say I worship the sun god, that means I admire and try to imitate those virtues I glean from the sun. Maybe it means I try to be warm to people, or I try to be creative, or I try to bring light and hope in dark places, etc.\"\n\nIn other words, the \"sun god\" isn't a real being in the real, physical universe. But the sun god is a real being in the moral sense: it is a valid metaphor, an allegory for a certain type of experience, or virtuous behavior, a pattern for a way to live life and make important choices. I can think of the sun god as \"real\" and yet understand perfectly well that it isn't the kind of entity I could invite to a bowling party. And without any contradiction or doublethink. \n\nBecause the scientific, physical realm and the religious, moral realm have two very different, unrelated definitions of \"real.\" In science, something is \"real\" if it can be shown to correspond to measurable physical reality. In religion, something is \"real\" if it can be shown to resonate with an aspect of human experience. A lot of people (on the internet) dismiss religion entirely because it can't correspond to the scientific definition of \"real\".

But the problems with the residential schools have been acknowledged and it is now time to put them in the history books and move on.I see many issues with leaving education in the hands of individual FN bands. Will children educated in a school system without adherence to a provincial or national standard at the elementary or secondary level be prepared for and accepted for post secondary education? I would hope so, unfortunately common sense and history suggests otherwise. There will be social pressure for race based quotas at post secondary schools and there will continue to be special 'indigenous' programs offered by colleges and universities. The latter are watered down versions (=lower academic standard) of courses/programs taken by non indigenous students. This not only hurts the first-nation student but puts a black mark on the institution. Every institution that I know of that endorses and participates in this 'race based' double standard is struggling to get peer recognition.

However, you completely misinterpret your own conclusions.\n\nYes, many (I would even say most) people post on this subreddit because it makes them feel good about themselves. They are experiencing social pressure (from the CMV community and probably from their social environment) encouraging them to be intelligent and open-minded. This leads them to doing intelligent and open-minded things, such as post on CMV. The comments on their post compliment them on their intelligence and open-mindedness, which makes them feel good about it, but that is legitimate, since their behaviour on this subreddit is truly intelligent and open-minded.\n\nThis is how social pressure works. Your social environment defines good and bad, and every time you do something good the feedback you get from your environment is rewarding, every time you do something bad the feedback is punishing. Social pressure is at the core of our society, and it is what makes our personality. Everything you do is influenced by social pressure.\n\nYou might find that this is a very unsatisfactory way of acting, and that people shouldn't post on CMV guided by social pressure. If so, let me ask you : why would they post? To get their view changed? No one wants to get their view changed. Finding out that you are wrong is very unpleasant. Sure, they could post here with the intention of being right by getting their view changed when they are wrong, but if that was the only motivation, then only people who are uncertain about their opinion would do that. The more certain people are about their opinion, the more it would hurt them to be wrong, and the less likely they are to try to get their view changed.\n\nThe sad truth is : humans don't naturally want to get their view changed. They don't have a natural tendency to confront their views to reality or to counter-arguments, and in fact it's quiet the opposite. Humans tend to cling to their opinions as soon as they have them, and they never question them. This is what leads to the world we live in, in which so many people are clearly wrong, and they don't know it because they just never listened to an argument against their views in their entire lives.\n\nThe comforting truth is : society can do something about that. You can't change human nature, but you can compensate it with social pressure. There is a small sub-group of humanity (of which the CMV community is a part) which has defined seeking the truth as a good action, and which encourages it with social pressure. The CMV community rewards intelligent and open-minded behaviour, and this is how the people of this sub can defeat the weakness of the human mind. The pride we feel when we allow our view to be changed gives us the strength to seek the truth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.4"}]}

Is the global population still growing? Undoubtedly. But the rate of that growth is slowing significantly. According to UN census data, global population growth is set to peak in 2035. After that point, we'll have a *negative* population growth rate. We hit 7,000,000,000 people on Earth in 2010, and by 2085 - we'll be back at that same 7,000,000,000. If trends continue throughout the 2XXXs, after 2035, we'll be losing 1,000,000,000 ever 20 years. So, it's likely that the Earth's population will peak at somewhere around 9,500,000,000 in 2035, but will decline back to current levels by 2085 and to around 6,250,000,000 by 2100.\n\nSo, why does this make reproduction a human right? Because any efforts to curtail reproduction among those who *want* to reproduce jeopardizes the continuation of our species. The people with the unimpeded freedom to reproduce are, simply, not reproducing. Higher levels of economic achievement, women's rights, social mobility, and consumerism all correlate to lower birth rates. Simply: **people who *should* have more children have fewer children**. If you're proposing to limit reproductive freedom based on economic status or emotionally competency, you're ignoring the fact that those people who would meet your criteria are (at present) choosing *not* to reproduce. That choice is (or at least: will) have disastrous consequences for human societies and the human race.  \n\nIt's like this: people who have the ability to control their fertility and who have the freedom to choose greater economic success or more material goods over children will invariably choose the former. If your proposition is that families who choose fewer children will be supported by social safety nets: who are you assuming will fund those safety nets? If populations decline and there are fewer taxpayers - how do you assume that some families will continue to have children: given increasing tax burdens?\n\nUltimately, given current trends, we should be *encouraging* more reproduction. If social safety nets are the answer - we need at least a stable population to sustain them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.7"}]}

Then, the platform should look at the primary source of misery in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Over-population! Why are the guys at the U.N. so blind to this fact? Though Alan Kurdi's death was a tragedy, the problems in his homeland were an explosive mix of over-population and religious rivalries. The west cannot solve these self-imposed foreign problems unless the west?s values and methods are adopted, and they cannot possibly accommodate all the millions of refugees who are not even welcomed by neighbouring Gulf States. Add in the wild cards of Islamic State, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other terrorist groups, who also operate campaigns in the west. How can all these wars of the 8th Century continue to be fought centuries later? No matter how many refugees are taken in by western nations, their numbers continue to grow and grow, and U.N. statistics confirm this. Here is the UNHCR's disheartening data on the refugee crisis from 2013: http://unhcr.org/globaltrendsjune2013/UNHCR%20GLOBAL%20TRENDS%202012_V08_web.pdf We learn an estimated 45.2-million people were displaced in one year (2012 - 2013), and that number has risen since 1994. Where did refugees comes from at the end of 2012 (that's ONE year's data), and in what numbers? Afghanistan 2,585,600; Somalia 1,136,100; Iraq 746, 400; Syria 728, 500; Sudan 569, 200; Democratic Republic of Congo 509, 400; Mynamar 415, 300; Colombia 394, 100;Vietnam 336, 900; Eritrea 285, 100. Many of these areas disdain western values -- how would they adapt to being 'transplanted'? Look to Holland's experience, and the resulting changes to its immigration and refugee programs. The Syrian crisis has been highlighted in the UNHCR's latest report as 'a major new factor in global displacement'. 55% of refugees listed in the report come from five countries affected by war; Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Sudan. We already know where the next crisis is brewing ... again: Ethiopia. In 1984, when Ethiopia's population was 40-million, there was a terrible famine. Funds were raised, refugee camps were established. Famine stalks the overworked landscape again in 2016, but what is the primary difference between 1984 and 2016? Ethiopia's population is now 95.51-million in 2014, and that population is growing at close to 5% per year every year. If Ethiopia could not feed 40-million, how on earth can it feed close to 100-million people today?

No, it's a deadly game of trial and error. It's the same for being human.\n\nWe are condemned to suffering. Everything which lives will die at some point. The world is cruel, we are fighting every day for our survival. While this isn't so apparent for most people in industrialized countries, it's nonseless true. There is no escape to this system. Being alive means to change, to adapt, to fight the odds. It's do or die. And even if we did everything right, we still are going to die at some point.\n\nFrom my perspective, this whole metaphysical \"heaven &amp; hell\" thing is pretty pointless. We already do live in such an enviroment. No need to get metaphysical there.\n\nYou think, it could get much worse than what our world has to offer, in terms of pain and suffering? You might want to check out what war is, what torture means, what the Holocaust was. Pretty grim already, right?\nOn the other hand, this world already offers eternal bliss, if you are lucky/blessed enough to receive it. Both sides already exist in our lives!\n\nMy point is, evolution is a thing in our world. Evolution is cruel, whole races die out all the time. But even on a personal level, would you say people don't learn things throughout their lives? I'd say people can only learn through suffering, by commiting mistakes, by being a sinner. \n\nI'd also argue, if you are a true sinner, you won't be able to reach real fulfillment during your lifetime. How many people can look back at their lives and say, they did all they could and had an awesome, fulfilling life? Very few I'd say. Most people are really scared of dying, think about regretful decisions or might even die alone, unloved and forgotten.\n\nIsn't that enough punishment? Having only one life and realizing at the end, you wasted your one chance at it?\n\n**TL;DR: **\n\nThe only way God might have prevented us from being/becoming sinners, would have been to make us perfect from the start. Obviously this wasn't his plan.\n\nIf we are to grow, personally and as a species, we need to make mistakes. Mistakes lead to suffering, otherwise we wouldn't be able to see them as mistakes. Without suffering, there would be no need for change. But growing is essentially the same as changing. Thus, suffering is necessary for growth.\n\nIf you don't live good lives, you will quite likely not end up happy and content with your life. Hell is described as a place of eternal suffering. \n\nNot being able to achieve happiness during your lifetime seems to be exactly that. Always being insecure, maybe not being loved, having no place in society, not being able to enjoy peace and prosperity. Knowing your life amounted to nothing. \n\nBut are we condemned to exactly this type of life? No, we can learn, we can improve our lives, we can grow as a species! We have the possibility to create our own paradise here on Earth! Just...failing to do so, will result in endless suffering, for a huge amount of people. \n\nWe don't need God to judge us, our own choices will result in good or bad things, blessing or punishing us.

We have case ending in some parts of the language (I, me, my, mine) for example, but not for everything like German does.  In German, you not only have to worry about number (one or many) but case and *gender* (masculine, feminine or neuter).  Word order is also a bit tricky.

It would take too long to find the information (assuming we aren't talking google here, and literally open text book).  You also then rely on someone spending all their time knowing where the information is in a specific book or making 'cheat sheets' instead of trying to actually understand the material.\n\n* There is merit in knowing something in your head vs simply being able to research it.  By forcing you to demonstrate a concept during an exam without any assistance, it means you have LEARNED how to formulate the answer by understanding the building blocks that got you there.  \n\nNow are some people able to memorize things so well that they don't have to learn and can just go by memorization?  Most definitely.  That's why people who have excellent memories can do so well in most aspects of school without really being that smart or truly understanding things.  I had a few friends like this.  They did amazingly well in all of my classes, but they did not truly understand the material as well as I did, even if I had a lower grade.\n\nHowever most people cannot rely on pure memorization (which is a good thing).  You have to understand the material to be able to 'memorize' some formulas/way of doing something.  I always thought Math was a perfect example of this.  There is very little in math you actually need to memorize.  What you call memorization, I call understanding core concepts.  Are there some formulas that you simply memorize?  Of course.  But you will find that if you truly understand what you are doing, you actually don't need to memorize much of anything because you can always work out the problem from the roots.\n\nSo it's actually very beneficial to be put in a situation where you have to rely on nothing but your mind to solve a problem.\n\nThat being said.... you are right that some exams are way too geared toward pure memorization.  I think the real solution is to make it so exams don't rely on memorization, thus doing it open book doesn't really help.  I'll go back to math.  There is NO reason to have an exam asking someone to solve a problem where the only thing they do is plug numbers into the quadratic formula.  That is an example where it's pure memorizing a formula with plug and chug.  That's a great exercise for HOMEWORK but not an exam.  Word problems are the perfect exam problems because it tests your knowledge rather than pure memorization.  So in that respect, I suppose I might be changing my mind a little in that if the exams are done correctly and geared toward applied knowledge then they can be open book."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.4"}]}

We're very visual creatures, so we can't help but be impressed by people's appearances. \nI find it hard to compare the two however. People have never been systematically enslaved on the basis of height (though there is a history of exploiting little people). I think part of the prejudice is that smaller people are physically less intimidating, in general, so people feel like they can get away with pushing them around. With racism, discrimination is based more on stereotypes, history, and structural inequality. Also, height is measurable, while race is more of a social construct.

One idea from Apple could put up more of a roadblock. Published on Tuesday by the US Patent and Trademark Office, an Apple patent called \"Driver handheld computing device lock-out\" proposes a couple of different ways to cut off texting and other cell phone features while you're driving. In one scenario, Apple's technology would work on its own by detecting the motion of the driver and/or analyzing the surrounding scenery. The motion detector would use the phone's onboard sensors to tell if the car is moving beyond a certain speed. The scenery analyzer would use the phone's camera to determine if the phone is being held by the driver. If a red flag goes up, a lock-out mechanism would then automatically disable texting and other functions of the phone. In a second scenario, your car would essentially tell your phone when it's time to be quiet. After you start your car, your ignition key would send a signal to your phone to disable texting and other features. The first scenario sounds more complicated but may be more doable as it would rely solely on technology built into the phone. The second scenario sounds simpler but would require the involvement of automakers. ][...] http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-aims-to-disable-texting-while-youre-driving/ Lots more on the web, enter Google: \" stop drivers texting signal block \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.2"}]}
