To truly tackle this crisis, we must move away from gas-powered vehicles toward zero-emissions alternatives like electric cars. Banning new gas car sales after [2030] would accelerate this necessary transition, reducing emissions and saving lives.\nAccording to the WHO, 4.2 million premature deaths occur each year due to pollution from vehicles and other sources.

Transitioning to electric vehicles would cut emissions of toxic pollutants like nitrogen oxides by over 90% compared to gas-powered cars, resulting in immediate and substantial public health benefits.  \nClimate change also poses an urgent threat, and transportation accounts for nearly 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions according to the EPA. Replacing just half of the nation's gas-powered cars with EVs would reduce U.S. CO2 emissions by over 600 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of closing more than a dozen coal-fired power plants. By transitioning fully to EVs, the U.S. could achieve nearly half of the emissions cuts needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nWhile a ban on new gas car sales may seem drastic, it simply accelerates an inevitable and necessary transition that is already underway. Major automakers like GM and Volkswagen have announced plans to shift focus from gas to electric vehicles. As costs continue to fall, EVs are becoming more affordable and appealing to consumers.

Then, the platform should look at the primary source of misery in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Over-population! Why are the guys at the U.N. so blind to this fact? Though Alan Kurdi's death was a tragedy, the problems in his homeland were an explosive mix of over-population and religious rivalries. The west cannot solve these self-imposed foreign problems unless the west?s values and methods are adopted, and they cannot possibly accommodate all the millions of refugees who are not even welcomed by neighbouring Gulf States. Add in the wild cards of Islamic State, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other terrorist groups, who also operate campaigns in the west. How can all these wars of the 8th Century continue to be fought centuries later? No matter how many refugees are taken in by western nations, their numbers continue to grow and grow, and U.N. statistics confirm this. Here is the UNHCR's disheartening data on the refugee crisis from 2013: http://unhcr.org/globaltrendsjune2013/UNHCR%20GLOBAL%20TRENDS%202012_V08_web.pdf We learn an estimated 45.2-million people were displaced in one year (2012 - 2013), and that number has risen since 1994. Where did refugees comes from at the end of 2012 (that's ONE year's data), and in what numbers? Afghanistan 2,585,600; Somalia 1,136,100; Iraq 746, 400; Syria 728, 500; Sudan 569, 200; Democratic Republic of Congo 509, 400; Mynamar 415, 300; Colombia 394, 100;Vietnam 336, 900; Eritrea 285, 100. Many of these areas disdain western values -- how would they adapt to being 'transplanted'? Look to Holland's experience, and the resulting changes to its immigration and refugee programs. The Syrian crisis has been highlighted in the UNHCR's latest report as 'a major new factor in global displacement'. 55% of refugees listed in the report come from five countries affected by war; Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Sudan. We already know where the next crisis is brewing ... again: Ethiopia. In 1984, when Ethiopia's population was 40-million, there was a terrible famine. Funds were raised, refugee camps were established. Famine stalks the overworked landscape again in 2016, but what is the primary difference between 1984 and 2016? Ethiopia's population is now 95.51-million in 2014, and that population is growing at close to 5% per year every year. If Ethiopia could not feed 40-million, how on earth can it feed close to 100-million people today? As for 'refugee' migrants who went to Europe, consider the recent article by the Los Angeles Times: http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-refugees-20160301-story.html Migrants, who fled to the EU in boats, are buying one-way tickets home.

Costs will also inevitably decrease over time, as with all new medical innovations. In the interim, costs  can be mitigated through insurance coverage, charity programs, and government subsidies for those unable to afford treatment. Some argue this diversion of funds is unjustified, but ignoring the suffering of those with age-related diseases and conditions is equally unjustified.\nWhile living longer may present societal challenges, the opportunity to gain additional healthy, high-quality years of life is an extraordinary gift. For individuals and their loved ones, more time together despite the onset of aging can be invaluable. And for society as a whole, increasing longevity could allow greater generational knowledge transfer and continued contributions from elders. \nIn summary, anti-aging therapies offer enormous benefits that make ensuring widespread access - even if expensive - a moral imperative.

Forcing companies to calculate and report greenhouse gas emissions places an enormous administrative and financial burden on them, diverting resources away from productive business activities. Moreover, emissions are not always straightforward to quantify for many companies, especially those in the service sector, due to complex supply chains and business models. \n\nMandatory emissions disclosures will signal to investors and consumers that certain companies or even entire industries are 'dirtier' than others based on arbitrary metrics. This risks creating a stigma against companies that rely heavily on fossil fuels or energy-intensive processes to sustain jobs and economic activity. Some companies may feel pressure to make their emissions data look better on paper through questionable practices like carbon offsets or emissions trading schemes with little real-world impact.\n\nWhile environmental protection and fighting climate change are laudable goals, mandatory emissions reporting for all corporations is not an effective or fair way to achieve them. Governments would be better served introducing targeted policies and incentives to drive emissions reductions in high-polluting sectors.

No, it's a deadly game of trial and error. It's the same for being human.\n\nWe are condemned to suffering. Everything which lives will die at some point. The world is cruel, we are fighting every day for our survival. While this isn't so apparent for most people in industrialized countries, it's nonseless true. There is no escape to this system. Being alive means to change, to adapt, to fight the odds. It's do or die. And even if we did everything right, we still are going to die at some point.\n\nFrom my perspective, this whole metaphysical \"heaven &amp; hell\" thing is pretty pointless. We already do live in such an enviroment. No need to get metaphysical there.\n\nYou think, it could get much worse than what our world has to offer, in terms of pain and suffering? You might want to check out what war is, what torture means, what the Holocaust was. Pretty grim already, right?\nOn the other hand, this world already offers eternal bliss, if you are lucky/blessed enough to receive it. Both sides already exist in our lives!\n\nMy point is, evolution is a thing in our world. Evolution is cruel, whole races die out all the time. But even on a personal level, would you say people don't learn things throughout their lives? I'd say people can only learn through suffering, by commiting mistakes, by being a sinner. \n\nI'd also argue, if you are a true sinner, you won't be able to reach real fulfillment during your lifetime. How many people can look back at their lives and say, they did all they could and had an awesome, fulfilling life? Very few I'd say. Most people are really scared of dying, think about regretful decisions or might even die alone, unloved and forgotten.\n\nIsn't that enough punishment? Having only one life and realizing at the end, you wasted your one chance at it?\n\n**TL;DR: **\n\nThe only way God might have prevented us from being/becoming sinners, would have been to make us perfect from the start. Obviously this wasn't his plan.\n\nIf we are to grow, personally and as a species, we need to make mistakes. Mistakes lead to suffering, otherwise we wouldn't be able to see them as mistakes. Without suffering, there would be no need for change. But growing is essentially the same as changing. Thus, suffering is necessary for growth.\n\nIf you don't live good lives, you will quite likely not end up happy and content with your life. Hell is described as a place of eternal suffering. \n\nNot being able to achieve happiness during your lifetime seems to be exactly that. Always being insecure, maybe not being loved, having no place in society, not being able to enjoy peace and prosperity. Knowing your life amounted to nothing. \n\nBut are we condemned to exactly this type of life? No, we can learn, we can improve our lives, we can grow as a species! We have the possibility to create our own paradise here on Earth! Just...failing to do so, will result in endless suffering, for a huge amount of people. \n\nWe don't need God to judge us, our own choices will result in good or bad things, blessing or punishing us.

We have case ending in some parts of the language (I, me, my, mine) for example, but not for everything like German does.  In German, you not only have to worry about number (one or many) but case and *gender* (masculine, feminine or neuter).  Word order is also a bit tricky.  And given that English isn't very phonetic in spelling, learning to READ English is difficult for a lot of people.  In most European languages other than English, if you can pronounce the word and you know the way the sounds are written in that language you can read and write in that language.   \n\nI think that given the difficulty of learning the language has to be taken into account here.  It's not easy to move to a new country and learn a new language under the best of circumstances.

It would take too long to find the information (assuming we aren't talking google here, and literally open text book).  You also then rely on someone spending all their time knowing where the information is in a specific book or making 'cheat sheets' instead of trying to actually understand the material.\n\n* There is merit in knowing something in your head vs simply being able to research it.  By forcing you to demonstrate a concept during an exam without any assistance, it means you have LEARNED how to formulate the answer by understanding the building blocks that got you there.  \n\nNow are some people able to memorize things so well that they don't have to learn and can just go by memorization?  Most definitely.  That's why people who have excellent memories can do so well in most aspects of school without really being that smart or truly understanding things.  I had a few friends like this.  They did amazingly well in all of my classes, but they did not truly understand the material as well as I did, even if I had a lower grade.\n\nHowever most people cannot rely on pure memorization (which is a good thing).  You have to understand the material to be able to 'memorize' some formulas/way of doing something.  I always thought Math was a perfect example of this.  There is very little in math you actually need to memorize.  What you call memorization, I call understanding core concepts.  Are there some formulas that you simply memorize?  Of course.  But you will find that if you truly understand what you are doing, you actually don't need to memorize much of anything because you can always work out the problem from the roots.\n\nSo it's actually very beneficial to be put in a situation where you have to rely on nothing but your mind to solve a problem.\n\nThat being said.... you are right that some exams are way too geared toward pure memorization.  I think the real solution is to make it so exams don't rely on memorization, thus doing it open book doesn't really help.  I'll go back to math.  There is NO reason to have an exam asking someone to solve a problem where the only thing they do is plug numbers into the quadratic formula.  That is an example where it's pure memorizing a formula with plug and chug.  That's a great exercise for HOMEWORK but not an exam.  Word problems are the perfect exam problems because it tests your knowledge rather than pure memorization.  So in that respect, I suppose I might be changing my mind a little in that if the exams are done correctly and geared toward applied knowledge then they can be open book."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.41447232761384"}]}

Requiring social media platforms to verify the identities of their users would undermine this fundamental purpose and infringe on our basic rights and freedoms.\n\nFirstly, anonymity on social media is crucial for protecting the privacy and safety of users, especially for vulnerable populations such as children, activists, or whistleblowers who may face retaliation or discrimination if their true identities were revealed. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, over 40% of social media users have reported experiencing online harassment, and mandatory identity verification could make these users even more susceptible to such threats.\n\nMoreover, identity verification would stifle the diversity of opinions and perspectives that thrive on social media platforms. Many individuals may be hesitant to voice unpopular or controversial views if their identities were exposed, leading to a chilling effect on free speech and the free exchange of ideas. As the First Amendment scholar, David L. Hudson Jr., argues, \"Anonymity is essential to the marketplace of ideas.\"\n\nAdditionally, the implementation of mandatory identity verification would pose significant technical and financial challenges for social media companies, potentially leading to increased costs that could be passed on to users or result in the exclusion of certain demographics from accessing these platforms altogether. According to a report by the Rand Corporation, the costs of implementing robust identity verification systems could be prohibitively high, especially for smaller social media platforms.\n\nIn conclusion, requiring social media platforms to verify user identities would undermine the fundamental principles of privacy, free speech, and accessibility that make these platforms so valuable to our society. Instead, we should focus on empowering users to make informed decisions about their own online engagement and protecting the rights and freedoms that are essential to a thriving digital landscape."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.30430021521222"}]}

One idea from Apple could put up more of a roadblock. Published on Tuesday by the US Patent and Trademark Office, an Apple patent called \"Driver handheld computing device lock-out\" proposes a couple of different ways to cut off texting and other cell phone features while you're driving. In one scenario, Apple's technology would work on its own by detecting the motion of the driver and/or analyzing the surrounding scenery. The motion detector would use the phone's onboard sensors to tell if the car is moving beyond a certain speed. The scenery analyzer would use the phone's camera to determine if the phone is being held by the driver. If a red flag goes up, a lock-out mechanism would then automatically disable texting and other functions of the phone. In a second scenario, your car would essentially tell your phone when it's time to be quiet. After you start your car, your ignition key would send a signal to your phone to disable texting and other features. The first scenario sounds more complicated but may be more doable as it would rely solely on technology built into the phone. The second scenario sounds simpler but would require the involvement of automakers. ][...] http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-aims-to-disable-texting-while-youre-driving/ Lots more on the web, enter Google: \" stop drivers texting signal block \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.18736861329912"}]}

Insurance companies must also comply with state\ninsurance laws when using credit information in the underwriting and rating process.\n\nA growing number of personal automobile and homeowner's insurance companies have begun looking at consumer credit information to decide whether to issue or renew policies or what premiums to charge for those policies.  Some insurance companies believe a direct statistical relationship exists between financial stability and losses. They believe, as a group, that consumers who show more financial responsibility have fewer and less costly losses and, therefore, should pay less for their insurance.  Conversely, they believe, as a group, that consumers who show less financial responsibility have more and costlier losses and, therefore, should pay more for their insurance.  Insurance companies using credit information and entities developing credit scoring models argue there is no difference in credit scores among different income levels because there are just as many financially responsible low-income consumers as there are financially responsible high-income consumers. In addition, these companies argue factors such as income, gender, marital status, religion, nationality, age, and location of property are not used in their credit scoring models.\n\nIf you feel as if you are being adversely affected by a low credit score with your insurance company there are some things that you can do.  Never be afraid to shop for a lower rate, you are not bound to anyone.  Consider increasing your deductible.  Pull a copy of your credit report, make sure that all of the information is correct, and dispute any discrepancies. Improve your credit history if you have past credit problems. Ask your agent or company for the top reasons (factors) for your credit score and the weighted number of each of these factors is given. If your credit score is causing you to pay higher premiums, ask if they will reevaluate you when you improve your credit. Just remember that bringing up your credit score can and will take time, so be prepared to play the long game.

Unemployment would rise among young and less educated demographics if employers eliminate entry-level jobs. \n\nWhile helping low-income Americans is a worthy goal, the minimum wage is too blunt an instrument. A nuanced, incremental approach allows businesses to adjust while still providing a reasonable living wage. There are better ways to aid working families like the Earned Income Tax Credit. With good intentions, a $15 minimum wage would inadvertently harm job opportunities for those it aims to help."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.61537806263627"}]}
