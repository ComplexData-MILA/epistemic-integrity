"Strictly speaking, the examples you give describe discrimination on the basis of race and sex respectively because they simply show someone making a decision solely on those facts.  That being said, I don't think the typical scenario would have someone making a decision solely on those facts.  They would be taking the environment, the dress, demeanor, and physicality of the person they are judging, and any specific actions (among other things) into account as well and I'm pretty sure that only after the fact might they say that they singled out one specific thing.  There's a big difference between avoiding out of fear a small black man in gang clothing leering at you, licking his lips in the ghetto where murders and rapes happen all the time and avoiding a large black man in a 3-piece suit giving you a warm smile in a well-to-do rich people neighborhood.

That all being said, removing all other factors from the equation but sex in one and race in the other you have to admit one thing, there is a broad overlap between the two.  Many people who might admit to crossing the street to avoid a black man would, I imagine not say they'd do the same thing for a black woman.

"Okay, so I have a huge issue with your CMV. Your title is a fact. Period. Even many of us TODAY look at our farming practices with horror. 

However, then you go on to push veganism.

Do you want me to change your view on the way future generations view us or eating meat?


Because the way I see it, it doesn't matter what future generations think of us. They (as in ANY future generation) will ALWAYS find something in their countries past that will make them realize just how uneducated/barbaric/ect they were. Look at slavery. It wasn't even abolished 200 years ago. 

I'm POSITIVE that the future kids will find SOMETHING in the past that will make them realize how barbaric we are, and living a life style to ""not harm the future generations emotionally"" is just simply not something ANYONE should worry about.



On to veganism, I'm well aware how bad the industry is for animals. I just simply don't care. I love the taste of meat. The ONLY time I will change is when lab-grown meat has the same texture and taste as fresh meat. Until then I expect most people won't change.",6.88952030177365,CMV
"Why should they eat the cats? Would the presumed net gain from killing a feral cat not be met by feeding the cat to a scavenger? Vultures are carnivores but they don't actively hunt, but rather they feed from the remains of the already dead.

  Furthermore, Why would you expect vegans to spend the time and resources to go out and actively seek and kill cats? I think, as a matter of efficiency, vegans are better off making positive impacts by avoiding the animal products markets. If they are willing to put effort into killing predatory animals, Why don't they instead try to sabotage mass production farms and potentially make a bigger impact than killing a few cats?",4.56759239098737,CMV
"Non-vegetarians have a moral scale, too. Do you eat dogs?  Chimpanzees?  Dolphins? Heck, why waste the good meat of a comatose human?  (if you ignored the same-species health risks, of course).

It not hypocritical for a vegan or vegetarian to have a moral scale, even if it's subjective.  Everyone draws the line somewhere, and there are plenty of difference between eggs and honey that are not-unreasonable places to draw that line, if you feel like it.

* The suffering a chicken goes through and the negatives of chicken farming completely dwarf any abuse that bees go through while producing honey.  
* Chickens are higher-order animals than bees and closer to humans.
* Honey is produced by bees intended as a food source.  Eggs are a  chicken's 

It's only hypocritical if the person claims their philosophy and edicts are based on logic or absolute truth, and then violates their own rules.  ""All animal products are 100% wrong"" would be such an edict.

"Except that your highschool and college career will suffer dramatically due to sports leaving you with a sub-par education and reduced career prospects in your post-sport career.

Long hours, paper classes, and potential injury for the slim chance of making to the NFL all while the college makes money off of you that you will never get yourself, is a pretty shitty college career.

Then if you make it to the NFL or NBA you may have a dream job, or you may have a career-ending injury that leaves you permanently disabled and unable to work in your given field.

And if you do make it out, then the brain injuries you likely experiences from playing such sports will see you develop early onset dementia as the CTE sets in from your brain literally being rattled inside your skull so often.

But let us say you make it out unscathed.

The average career length is 5 years, the average salary is $5 000 000/year.

In theory this seems like $25 000 000 in five years. 5 years of work for a lifetime of money.

Except that you immediately cut out 1/3 for taxes. Meaning you are down to $17m.

That sounds like a lot until you figure that you probably aren't going to be financially responsible. You are going to buy a nice car and a nice house with little to no resale value in the city which you play for.

Beyond this because few players look ahead in life they expect this kind of wealth to be continuous and don't properly save for their post-sport career.

Combine this with the pittance of an education they receive and there is no wonder that so many former players go bankrupt or end up as salesmen/spokespeople mooching off of their former fame.

For those 5ish years you are likely to be living the high life. Flying around the nation with almost no time spent at home playing a game where any wrong move could leave you permanently disabled, having thousands or millions of people cheer you on even though the majority will no take the time to learn your name and will not even not I e when next season your number is worn by someone else. And if you do get out alive you generally earn an average salary with the threat of impending mental illness around every corner.

"It sounds like you're taking the meaning of 'judgment' more literally than intended.

"There is a supply and demand mismatch though. With dogs, there are way more than enough stray dogs for people to adopt one from a shelter. 7 to 8.5 million dogs enter shelters each year, and 1.6 million of those dogs are adopted. It's much more expensive to get one from a breeder, and they specifically have to introduce more dogs into the world to sell. 44% of the US population has a dog in the house (that's 78 million dogs). 34% of dogs are purchased from breeders.

With children, there is a far lower supply of adoptable kids. It's far more effort to adopt a child than to create one. There were 4 million births in the US last year, and there are 100,000 kids waiting to be adopted in foster care (which has 400,000 kids in the system total). 20,000 of those kids age out of foster care, which means they were in foster care until they reached the age of 18-21. That means that there are only 20,000 kids each year who were never adopted. There's only 18 million orphans on Earth. That's a large, sad number, but it's only a quarter of a percent of the human population. The 20,000 foster kids who aren't adopted is also a very sad number, but it represents half a percentage of the number of live births in the US each year.

"I don't see a lot of smokers or former smokers yet on this thread, so let me give you the perspective of someone who's used tobacco.

I smoked cigarettes for 10 years: starting when I was 18, and have been tobacco-free for the last two (though I still use nicotine-replacement products). The thing about tobacco/nicotine that non-smokers don't (or can't) understand is how easy it is to normalize. Unlike alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs: nicotine produces no real altered state. You might get a small buzz off your first cigarette of the day, but it's so small as to be almost unnoticeable. By contrast, nicotine withdrawal is the absolute fucking worst. You're cranky, irritable, anxious, and twitchy until you get your next cigarette. 

Because smokers (or other tobacco users) don't experience a 'high', but experience severe withdrawal symptoms: it's really easy for us to treat our nicotine habit as a normal 'maintenance' activity. Smoking, for us, is like eating. You would never begrudge a person for having a snack when they get hungry: we smokers feel like that about our cigarettes. We *need* it, the same way you need food. Quitting smoking is like starving yourself - not like going on a diet, but literally depriving yourself of what your body is desperately telling you it needs. Imagine if doctors told overweight people that, instead of slimming down their portions or avoiding snacks, they needed to fast (eat nothing at all) until they lost the weight - that's what it feels like to quit smoking.

All of this **is not** to say that it's okay to smoke. Nicotine is not food or water: it's not essential to life, despite what our addicted brains may tell us. But that academic understanding is *not enough* to get smokers to quit. Neither, apparently, are the health risks, as millions of people continue to smoke. We need to give people other reasons to quit. Telling them that smoking is unattractive (as I agree that it is) is one more 'tool in the toolbox'. 

I speak from experience when I say: smokers will find all sorts of reasons to justify their habit. But underneath them all - we *all* want to quit. We just haven't found a good enough reason to do so yet. You're wrong if you think that smokers ignore the social stigma of smoking or that the stigma encourages them to keep using tobacco. In truth: we *hate* being confronted by the consequences of smoking, because we know that they're all true. We might rebel in the moment, but (deep down) we know that they're right. The message needs to be hammered, over and over, again and again; until something sticks. This Tinder ad campaign is just another prong of the attack, and I guarantee it *will* get some people to quit tobacco. 

Every smoker who quits tobacco will do so in their own way. But that's not to say that smokers should be coddled. We (smokers) all know that tobacco is harmful, unattractive, and socially-unacceptable. Reinforcing that message is the best way to get smokers to quit. Smokers normalize smoking so that it becomes part of their daily lives: the only way to snap them out of that behavior is to show that their daily lives are being impeded by their smoking.",7.63829419853543,CMV

In other words, if as a political system the governments of the world properly incentivize using less resources, capitalism will get us there the fastest.  

So, while humanity's end is unavoidable eventually, capitalism is probably our best tool for finding ways to slow it down (renewables, less reproduction, less wasted resources, etc).

"Camping is a legitimate strategy, I don't think ma y people would argue with you there because there's really nothing to argue it's true. However, this doesn't make the reasons people complain about campers any less valid.

To an inexperienced team, camping opponents bars them from getting enough experience to deal with them in the first place. It's hard to learn the ins and outs of a level or of the gameplay in general if you're getting sniped every 5 seconds and have no idea where it's coming from. Many people may expect to lose when they start out a new game but when opponents camp, it barely take a a few steps after spawning before you're dead. You may have to spend 5 or 6 rounds before you realize where someone is camping and by that point you may not have the technical capability to take them down right away without more practice. Essentially you're outmatched and not given the opportunity to get better because you keep dying so fast. At least losing in a legit firefight, both players can still have fun, constantly dying and respawning every few seconds is fun for nobody.

For experienced players, camping is an annoyance because a lot of the time it's the only way an opponent will play a level, find the place with the greatest tactical sniping advantage and pick people off until someone finally gets you or you get to them first. You probably know all the best spots just like your opponent and each round is just a race to get to that one spot. While you may want to mess around a little since doing the camping thing can get monotonous, there's never any guarantee your opponent will so you end up playing the same stages the same way all the time which makes a level with a ton of different options a slog since there's the one place where you can get cheap kills and anything more difficult sacrifices a sure thing.

"* Ivanka Trump went to a $55,000/year tuition boarding school.
* Her mother was a model, and she inherited her looks.
* She was on the cover of Seventeen magazine when she was only 16 years old.
* She was a legacy admit to Penn.
* She got an executive job at her dad's company after college.
* She is a billionaire heiress whose dad is now president of the United States.

I think women should certainly envy her, but I don't think she's a role model. A role model is someone people can relate to and try to emulate. Ivanka had everything in life handed to her on a silver platter. She inherited her looks, money, connections, etc. directly from her parents. She is a perfectly nice person, and isn't as spoiled as she might have been. But, she never achieved anything independently. The only way you can emulate Ivanka Trump is go back and time and win the genetic lottery.

Compare Ivanka to a real feminist hero like Malala Yousafzai. She stood up for women's education in Afghanistan by writing a blog exposing the Taliban's treatment of women. That blog turned into interviews and documentaries with American newspapers and other foreign press. In return, a gunman got on a bus, asked for her by name, and shot her in the head for it. She survived and continued to stand up for women's rights. Despite the assassination attempt and many opportunities to flee the country, she stayed put and continued to live under many more threats against her life. She went onto become the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17. She never even described herself as a feminist until 2015. She really was just fighting for what is right, not women or any specific group.

Ultimately, a person who *has* great things is someone to envy. A person who *achieves* great things is someone to admire. So I disagree that Ivanka is a strong role model for our youth. She is a perfectly nice person, but she hasn't done anything exceptional to warrant that position.",5.5915304375808,CMV
"I think the primary problem is that better is not a quality in and of itself, and is simply to vague to be meaningful without many more qualifiers. It is a relative way of measuring a particular quality. You have to talk about the actual quality being disputed before better or worse is meaningful. Once e focus on a particular quality of music, it becomes much easier to talk about better or worse. Technically better, emotionally more moving, more popular, more difficult, more ground breaking, etc. I think your entire premise is flawed because it lacks the necessary precision to make the question meaningful, like asking if Ronaldo is a better athlete than Djokovic.

"I got my BA in Marketing Management, and while I haven't worked in the field in about 5 years, I might have some perspective to offer this discussion.

First of all, your definition of Marketing is tailored to present itself in a way so that the only possible conclusion that could be drawn is the one presented in your title. Ironically, this is a common marketing tactic. (Bad breath is anything other than a minty smell! Thus, you need our minty gum to avoid bad breath.) In any case, your definition of Marketing is not the official one. Manipulation is certainly a tactic within marketing, but marketing itself is much broader than manipulation.

Marketing is anything one does to increase the likelihood that their product is chosen out of a field of competitors. This includes advertising. Advertising is a marketing activity, though again, marketing is a larger concept than advertising. But we can see already that your definitions are flawed, because you describe them as two separate things, when in fact one is simply a subset of the other.

Marketing techniques, at their most basic, simply ask two questions: 1) What need/desire does our product satisfy and 2) What kind of person has that need/desire. Everything from there is a result of the answer to those two questions. The advertising side of marketing is mostly just an expression of the first question. Telling everyone what your product does. The targeting side of marketing is an answer to the second question, and it affects everything from how people decide what magazines or TV stations to run their ads on, all the way down to what key phrases or colors to include in the add.

The manipulation comes in when marketers start trying to convince people that they have a need when they otherwise wouldn't be thinking about it. Using unrealistic looking models in every add to make people with otherwise healthy and attractive bodies feel insecure is the most common example. But this specific tactic, in and of itself, is not by any means all of marketing.

Marketing is completely necessary to function in a society with so many people/products/options. It would be completely inefficient to try selling wheel chairs to people with legs, or to sell steaks to vegans. That would be a complete waste of time and energy on your part. So you use marketing to cut through the ""noise"" of all the people that wouldn't be interested in your product, and to thus increase the frequency of ""impressions"" (number of people who are made aware of your product) to purchases.

Actually, everyone uses marketing. When you write a resume to apply for a job, that's a prime example of marketing. If you are applying for a position teaching English in a high school, you don't put on your resume your two years of working in a factory. It's irrelevant and to draw attention to it would be poor marketing. If you are applying for a position in the film industry, you want to showcase your creative skills, and make sure to work some industry buzz words in there so that they know you have some familiarity with it. Marketing.

So, in conclusion (that is, **tl;dr**) marketing is much bigger than what you have described. Marketing focuses on making efficient use of time when attempting to communicate your product as a choice in a field of competition, and everyone uses marketing on a personal level at some point in their life.",5.87413068092189,CMV

"Firstly, these rules are, in some circumstances, allowed to be broken. Your first example deals with people using adjacent urinals, if there are only two. In my experience, it is perfectly acceptable to use an adjacent urinal, if there are no other urinals available. It saves time, and, let's be honest, makes sense. I cannot imagine a reason why anyone would not use the second urinal, and instead line up for the first. If anything that was less to do with urinal etiquette, and more to do with an odd instance of conformity. Since no one else is doing it, neither will I.

Secondly, you mention talking to your favourite author, in the bathroom. Unfortunately, this etiquette is to make the most number of people feel comfortable, and most people are uncomfortable talking to someone else while, as you put it, ""holding their junk"". This is just a human discomfort, and since it is widely held in our culture, we have urinal etiquette. Do you really want to strike up a conversation with your favourite author in the bathroom? I imagine he might find it slightly unsettling. Additionally, if you shared a bathroom with him, for six months, I am certain you could have found time outside the bathroom to visit him, and simply express how big a fan you were.

Male urinal etiquette is adhered to in most cases, because it makes people comfortable, in a shared environment when they have to pull their junk out. In our society, expelling waste is an exceptionally private thing, and makes most people uncomfortable. Think of all the people who get stage fright with urinals, even as they are adhering to this code of etiquette.

"I'm not sure philosophy covers the same ground as religion, at least not modern western philosophy. It is an analytic practice, it seeks to understand the world of experience and truth in the same way that science seeks to understand the physical world and its laws. Philosophy doesn't offer a guide to life, or a practice. It can help illuminate and even answer some big moral questions like ""what is the right thing to do in x situation?"" 

But it can't really answer questions like ""What should I do with my life every day so that I feel fulfilled, so that I can be at peace with the dread of mortality?"" The only valid scientific answer is a shrug. Compare the philosophical study of Buddhism with the actual practice of Buddhism as a religion. They are two different things. 

If I tell you ""I worship the sun god,"" you'd probably say ""What? That's retarded. There is no such being."" You'd say I was an idiot for believing in a concept without evidence that the concept is real. 

But what if I say ""Now hold on. I don't mean that there's an actual dude who lives in the sun. The sun god is a personification, an allegory of a human being who has properties like the sun. When I say I worship the sun god, that means I admire and try to imitate those virtues I glean from the sun. Maybe it means I try to be warm to people, or I try to be creative, or I try to bring light and hope in dark places, etc.""

In other words, the ""sun god"" isn't a real being in the real, physical universe. But the sun god is a real being in the moral sense: it is a valid metaphor, an allegory for a certain type of experience, or virtuous behavior, a pattern for a way to live life and make important choices. I can think of the sun god as ""real"" and yet understand perfectly well that it isn't the kind of entity I could invite to a bowling party. And without any contradiction or doublethink. 

Because the scientific, physical realm and the religious, moral realm have two very different, unrelated definitions of ""real."" In science, something is ""real"" if it can be shown to correspond to measurable physical reality. In religion, something is ""real"" if it can be shown to resonate with an aspect of human experience. A lot of people (on the internet) dismiss religion entirely because it can't correspond to the scientific definition of ""real"". That pretty much entirely misses the point of religion.",2.87587517884061,CMV

Also, I think that just because someone wants to do something stupid it does not mean that they deserve death.

"First, let me congratulate you on the intelligence and open-mindedness of your post.

Secondly, you are absolutely right. However, you completely misinterpret your own conclusions.

Yes, many (I would even say most) people post on this subreddit because it makes them feel good about themselves. They are experiencing social pressure (from the CMV community and probably from their social environment) encouraging them to be intelligent and open-minded. This leads them to doing intelligent and open-minded things, such as post on CMV. The comments on their post compliment them on their intelligence and open-mindedness, which makes them feel good about it, but that is legitimate, since their behaviour on this subreddit is truly intelligent and open-minded.

This is how social pressure works. Your social environment defines good and bad, and every time you do something good the feedback you get from your environment is rewarding, every time you do something bad the feedback is punishing. Social pressure is at the core of our society, and it is what makes our personality. Everything you do is influenced by social pressure.

You might find that this is a very unsatisfactory way of acting, and that people shouldn't post on CMV guided by social pressure. If so, let me ask you : why would they post? To get their view changed? No one wants to get their view changed. Finding out that you are wrong is very unpleasant. Sure, they could post here with the intention of being right by getting their view changed when they are wrong, but if that was the only motivation, then only people who are uncertain about their opinion would do that. The more certain people are about their opinion, the more it would hurt them to be wrong, and the less likely they are to try to get their view changed.

The sad truth is : humans don't naturally want to get their view changed. They don't have a natural tendency to confront their views to reality or to counter-arguments, and in fact it's quiet the opposite. Humans tend to cling to their opinions as soon as they have them, and they never question them. This is what leads to the world we live in, in which so many people are clearly wrong, and they don't know it because they just never listened to an argument against their views in their entire lives.

The comforting truth is : society can do something about that. You can't change human nature, but you can compensate it with social pressure. There is a small sub-group of humanity (of which the CMV community is a part) which has defined seeking the truth as a good action, and which encourages it with social pressure. The CMV community rewards intelligent and open-minded behaviour, and this is how the people of this sub can defeat the weakness of the human mind.

there are real tangible medical benefits to marijuana. legalization is one of the way's to open up more research into the substance. this reason alone should be enough to legalize it. i just don't see how you can keep something that may save lives (pain medication overdose kills plenty every year) illegal simply because you think someone might abuse it. if that's the case then alcohol, pain medication, ciggarettes, cars, helium, etc should all be illegal.

So, it's likely that the Earth's population will peak at somewhere around 9,500,000,000 in 2035, but will decline back to current levels by 2085 and to around 6,250,000,000 by 2100.

So, why does this make reproduction a human right? Because any efforts to curtail reproduction among those who *want* to reproduce jeopardizes the continuation of our species. The people with the unimpeded freedom to reproduce are, simply, not reproducing. Higher levels of economic achievement, women's rights, social mobility, and consumerism all correlate to lower birth rates. Simply: **people who *should* have more children have fewer children**. If you're proposing to limit reproductive freedom based on economic status or emotionally competency, you're ignoring the fact that those people who would meet your criteria are (at present) choosing *not* to reproduce. That choice is (or at least: will) have disastrous consequences for human societies and the human race.  

It's like this: people who have the ability to control their fertility and who have the freedom to choose greater economic success or more material goods over children will invariably choose the former. If your proposition is that families who choose fewer children will be supported by social safety nets: who are you assuming will fund those safety nets? If populations decline and there are fewer taxpayers - how do you assume that some families will continue to have children: given increasing tax burdens?

Ultimately, given current trends, we should be *encouraging* more reproduction. If social safety nets are the answer - we need at least a stable population to sustain them.",6.72027696352078,CMV

"In my experience, the more exposure you have to people of a certain race, the easier they are to tell apart.  If you have only met a few people for eastern Asian, then a major defining feature of their appearance to you is their race.  This is something that happens subconsciously and there is nothing wrong with that.  However, if you have more contact with people of a similar race, you will instinctively notice more subtle differences.  I grew up in an area with a large variety of differences present, so I have no more difficulty telling different Asians apart than I do with different white people (my own race).",3.80203137921823,CMV

"How do you think evolution works? Through being comfy and lazy? No, it's a deadly game of trial and error. It's the same for being human.

We are condemned to suffering. Everything which lives will die at some point. The world is cruel, we are fighting every day for our survival. While this isn't so apparent for most people in industrialized countries, it's nonseless true. There is no escape to this system. Being alive means to change, to adapt, to fight the odds. It's do or die. And even if we did everything right, we still are going to die at some point.

From my perspective, this whole metaphysical ""heaven &amp; hell"" thing is pretty pointless. We already do live in such an enviroment. No need to get metaphysical there.

You think, it could get much worse than what our world has to offer, in terms of pain and suffering? You might want to check out what war is, what torture means, what the Holocaust was. Pretty grim already, right?
On the other hand, this world already offers eternal bliss, if you are lucky/blessed enough to receive it. Both sides already exist in our lives!

My point is, evolution is a thing in our world. Evolution is cruel, whole races die out all the time. But even on a personal level, would you say people don't learn things throughout their lives? I'd say people can only learn through suffering, by commiting mistakes, by being a sinner. 

I'd also argue, if you are a true sinner, you won't be able to reach real fulfillment during your lifetime. How many people can look back at their lives and say, they did all they could and had an awesome, fulfilling life? Very few I'd say. Most people are really scared of dying, think about regretful decisions or might even die alone, unloved and forgotten.

Isn't that enough punishment? Having only one life and realizing at the end, you wasted your one chance at it?

**TL;DR: **

The only way God might have prevented us from being/becoming sinners, would have been to make us perfect from the start. Obviously this wasn't his plan.

If we are to grow, personally and as a species, we need to make mistakes. Mistakes lead to suffering, otherwise we wouldn't be able to see them as mistakes. Without suffering, there would be no need for change. But growing is essentially the same as changing. Thus, suffering is necessary for growth.

If you don't live good lives, you will quite likely not end up happy and content with your life. Hell is described as a place of eternal suffering. 

Not being able to achieve happiness during your lifetime seems to be exactly that. Always being insecure, maybe not being loved, having no place in society, not being able to enjoy peace and prosperity. Knowing your life amounted to nothing. 

But are we condemned to exactly this type of life? No, we can learn, we can improve our lives, we can grow as a species! We have the possibility to create our own paradise here on Earth! Just...failing to do so, will result in endless suffering, for a huge amount of people. 

We don't need God to judge us, our own choices will result in good or bad things, blessing or punishing us. God made us, the rest is up to ourselves. ",3.89059623528046,CMV
"Well, it depends on what you mean by ""learn English""?  Are we talking about complete fluency or ""I can ask where the bathroom is"" fluency?  You can actually get along fairly well with limited English unless you're doing ""brainwork"" type jobs that require extensive reading and writing.  You don't need a lot of English to clean a restroom or stock a shelf or make a cheeseburger.    Even for an emergency, you don't need to be able to understand Shakespearean English, you need to understand ""Fire, Get out"" or ""put your hands up"".

English actually has a lot of [quirks](http://www.xamuel.com/10-reasons-why-english-is-hard-language/) that make learning it difficult for non-native speakers.  We have case ending in some parts of the language (I, me, my, mine) for example, but not for everything like German does.  In German, you not only have to worry about number (one or many) but case and *gender* (masculine, feminine or neuter).  Word order is also a bit tricky.  And given that English isn't very phonetic in spelling, learning to READ English is difficult for a lot of people.  In most European languages other than English, if you can pronounce the word and you know the way the sounds are written in that language you can read and write in that language.   

I think that given the difficulty of learning the language has to be taken into account here.  It's not easy to move to a new country and learn a new language under the best of circumstances.  I've had years of Spanish, but even after college level Spanish, I'd probably have a very difficult time doing a complex job in Spanish.  And Spanish is fairly simple (regular spellings, most verbs follow regular patterns, etc.) not like English would be for Spanish speakers.  I don't think it's realistic to expect someone just off of a plane from wherever to learn English to a high level within 5 years, maybe not even 10 years.",2.62579447117205,CMV
"Nothing is important unless you make it important. Holidays aren't ""important"" either, they're just some days that people have agreed have meaning for one reason or another. In practice, though, many people have something they do on holidays. For me it's an excuse to do something with my family, go to someone's house for dinner and drinks, have a good time together. It's widely socially recognized and doesn't require any extra vacation days, so it's pretty great. A good way to stay connected, whether the story behind the day is meaningful or not. 
  
Birthdays are similar, but they're for the individual. It's one day out of the year to wave away your obligations and do something for yourself, maybe even something memorable. Or at least it can be. It can also be nothing at all. As far as entitlement goes, I don't think it really *should* necessarily come with entitlement, but it kind of *does* to a limited degree. It shouldn't necessarily mean all that much to most people, but it seems it's pretty expected that it be recognized by your parents and/or children and anyone you're in a relationship with. Sometimes it extends to friends, but not as a general rule.

"* One answer is there simply isn't time to take every exam the way you are suggesting.  It would take too long to find the information (assuming we aren't talking google here, and literally open text book).  You also then rely on someone spending all their time knowing where the information is in a specific book or making 'cheat sheets' instead of trying to actually understand the material.

* There is merit in knowing something in your head vs simply being able to research it.  By forcing you to demonstrate a concept during an exam without any assistance, it means you have LEARNED how to formulate the answer by understanding the building blocks that got you there.  

Now are some people able to memorize things so well that they don't have to learn and can just go by memorization?  Most definitely.  That's why people who have excellent memories can do so well in most aspects of school without really being that smart or truly understanding things.  I had a few friends like this.  They did amazingly well in all of my classes, but they did not truly understand the material as well as I did, even if I had a lower grade.

However most people cannot rely on pure memorization (which is a good thing).  You have to understand the material to be able to 'memorize' some formulas/way of doing something.  I always thought Math was a perfect example of this.  There is very little in math you actually need to memorize.  What you call memorization, I call understanding core concepts.  Are there some formulas that you simply memorize?  Of course.  But you will find that if you truly understand what you are doing, you actually don't need to memorize much of anything because you can always work out the problem from the roots.

So it's actually very beneficial to be put in a situation where you have to rely on nothing but your mind to solve a problem.

That being said.... you are right that some exams are way too geared toward pure memorization.  I think the real solution is to make it so exams don't rely on memorization, thus doing it open book doesn't really help.  I'll go back to math.  There is NO reason to have an exam asking someone to solve a problem where the only thing they do is plug numbers into the quadratic formula.  That is an example where it's pure memorizing a formula with plug and chug.  That's a great exercise for HOMEWORK but not an exam.  Word problems are the perfect exam problems because it tests your knowledge rather than pure memorization.  So in that respect, I suppose I might be changing my mind a little in that if the exams are done correctly and geared toward applied knowledge then they can be open book.",4.41447232761384,CMV

"I think this is more of a conversation concerning structure, rather than quality. I'm not sure why the structure of a trilogy means it is good or bad necessarily.

There are a lot of ways to tell a story, and LOTR is more like an epic than it is a movie. The books themselves are actually broken up into six parts, and it tells the story of Frodo and the Ring in more of an episodic sort of way. It's about the whole journey.

If you enjoy the thing as a whole, then I think it's fair to say its a good trilogy. Do you think the only good television shows are ones where each episode works on its own? Trilogies are a whole, to be judged as a whole. We already have a name for individual works that we judge them by - movies.

I find it hard to compare the two however. People have never been systematically enslaved on the basis of height (though there is a history of exploiting little people). I think part of the prejudice is that smaller people are physically less intimidating, in general, so people feel like they can get away with pushing them around. With racism, discrimination is based more on stereotypes, history, and structural inequality. Also, height is measurable, while race is more of a social construct.
