I've attended a few seminars put on by wind power advocates as an observer and was not impressed. First, to be clear, I'm a big alternate energy proponent just as much as the next guy - methane power on large farms, for example, not only turns methane that would normally spill into the atmosphere into power, but the end product is a high quality sellable fertilizer that generates income and more than pays for the system. Ground source heat pumps, solar panels, small hydro electric dams, and even small windmill installations that assist in taking individual homes or farms off the grid are all great and interest me tremendously. Putting the argument of CO2/anthropomorphic vs. an indeterminate cyclical planetary induced global warming aside, as I think the jury is still out on the cause as there are major flaws on the CO2 side, I still basically believe like most Canadians it's a good idea to ween us off fossil fuels for the basic reason that we will eventually run out of this source of energy. Anyway, what does not interest me as an alternate energy source are the massive windmills being imposed upon the public by what can only be described as manically obsessive-compulsive proponents. Everything that you've said is absolutely correct and the Green Goons that support this energy approach in Ontario don't give a rodent's derriere about ecology, our beautiful rural Ontario landscapes, potential health issues, real estate values, or even what is happening in Europe in reconition of real public concerns. Many countries are rightfully responding to the problems and are putting these ugly, imposing behemoths offshore or at the very least, much farther away from homes. What is unacceptable from these Green Goons, is the outright dismissal of any and all opposition to their cause - we're just anti-planet right wing fascists or we're anti-alternate energy or it's all in our heads or we're all self-centred NIMBYs. We're something and we're wrong. Period. YET, these same people keep coming back to us and telling us that they will listen to every single individual and every single argument from a opponent and properly address it.Well they haven't addressed it. And what they haven't addressed is the steadily growing consensus against this form of energy for all of the reasons that they've delusioned themselves into thinking they've successfully addressed. What the windmill industry needs, is a massive wake up call to reality - either by the courts or by an election, or both."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "6.7"}]}

That's a pretty nervous interim period when there are new ICBMs coming off the rack...."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5.1"}]}

Poverty has instead grown. In solidifying progressive support the Libs would do well to push for a major expansion of the child tax benefit, using existing funds from the Harperites slice and dice scattershot policies as well as new revenues from increased taxes on wealth. Spending on child poverty has been shown to have the highest multipllier of any government investment since child poverty has lifetime consequences in diminished mental and physical health and educational outcomes. Also, poor families spend all new money immediately on high-multiplier basics. Getting rid of child poverty pays for itself as well as being morally just and popular as public opinion surveys show. Trudeau should avoid the 'no new taxes' trap. The GST cuts were universally condemned by tax economists and a restoration would enable a large increase in the tax refund, helping all low-income Canadians.

There are always going to be people in our society (Aboriginal or not) who are going to need help. There are plenty of problems where I live.

It is STUNNING the way that a journalist can cherry-pick a few items here and there in America, and thus feed into CANADA'S own paranoia that Americans are constantly bad-mouthing Canada. Americans rarely have the subject of Canada even cross their minds. Americans rarely talk about Canada. You could live in many American cities listening to your favourite radio station all year long, and in a typical year, the entire year, you might hear Canada mentioned once, in one single news story. And in that same period you would have heard a thousand news items about Washington, and a hundred about each of California, New York and Chicago. So the columnist was able to find an example here and an example there of American 'paranoia' about Canada. It is FASCINATING that the columnist decided to omit that one little, um, fact, that Algerian Canadian Ahmed Ressam was the Millennium Bomber who tried to cross into America from the Vancouver area in order to bomb the Los Angeles airport. Hello? By 'forgetting' to mention that fact, the columnist leaves the realm of writing an informative column, and he instead enters the realm of smear-propaganda. Which is ironic - given that he pretends to be railing against that from his soap box. The columnists makes a mountain out of a molehill in order to (mixing metaphors here) toss some red meat in front of his excitable Canadian readers. Again, the irony is dripping, considering his ostensible criticism of American comment! MSNBC mentioned the Canadian border on Hardball with liberal Chris Mathews. Mathews played a clip of an angry-sounding southern politician ranting on about 'the border', meaning the Mexican border being allegedly leaky for disease and/or terrorists. Mathews smartly opined something like: 'What is with these politicians who target only the Mexican border as a source of possible threat? Is it because they are racist? Is it because there are brown people down there who don't speak English? Is it because it plays to a racist segment of their electorate? Why is it that, relatively speaking, those same politicians almost never complain about the Canadian border? It is twice as long and 90 percent of it is easily pass-able wilderness, and we have already had a terrorist try to cross it, intent on blowing up the Los Angeles Airport?' Matthews was not saying that Canadians should be scapegoats for threats to America, the man loves Canada and says so - he was simply pointing out the hypocrisy of those US politicians who only stew about possible problems of one border, the southern one. That comment of Chris Mathews on MSNBC, just before the shows of Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow, was smart and fair, and contains reason and insight and balanced analysis. Perhaps some day the columnist in this paper could strive for those attributes in his columns about America..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "7.3"}]}

Then, the platform should look at the primary source of misery in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Over-population! Why are the guys at the U.N. so blind to this fact? Though Alan Kurdi's death was a tragedy, the problems in his homeland were an explosive mix of over-population and religious rivalries. The west cannot solve these self-imposed foreign problems unless the west?s values and methods are adopted, and they cannot possibly accommodate all the millions of refugees who are not even welcomed by neighbouring Gulf States. Add in the wild cards of Islamic State, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other terrorist groups, who also operate campaigns in the west. How can all these wars of the 8th Century continue to be fought centuries later? No matter how many refugees are taken in by western nations, their numbers continue to grow and grow, and U.N. statistics confirm this. Here is the UNHCR's disheartening data on the refugee crisis from 2013: http://unhcr.org/globaltrendsjune2013/UNHCR%20GLOBAL%20TRENDS%202012_V08_web.pdf We learn an estimated 45.2-million people were displaced in one year (2012 - 2013), and that number has risen since 1994. Where did refugees comes from at the end of 2012 (that's ONE year's data), and in what numbers? Afghanistan 2,585,600; Somalia 1,136,100; Iraq 746, 400; Syria 728, 500; Sudan 569, 200; Democratic Republic of Congo 509, 400; Mynamar 415, 300; Colombia 394, 100;Vietnam 336, 900; Eritrea 285, 100. Many of these areas disdain western values -- how would they adapt to being 'transplanted'? Look to Holland's experience, and the resulting changes to its immigration and refugee programs. The Syrian crisis has been highlighted in the UNHCR's latest report as 'a major new factor in global displacement'. 55% of refugees listed in the report come from five countries affected by war; Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Sudan. We already know where the next crisis is brewing ... again: Ethiopia. In 1984, when Ethiopia's population was 40-million, there was a terrible famine. Funds were raised, refugee camps were established. Famine stalks the overworked landscape again in 2016, but what is the primary difference between 1984 and 2016? Ethiopia's population is now 95.51-million in 2014, and that population is growing at close to 5% per year every year. If Ethiopia could not feed 40-million, how on earth can it feed close to 100-million people today? As for 'refugee' migrants who went to Europe, consider the recent article by the Los Angeles Times: http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-refugees-20160301-story.html Migrants, who fled to the EU in boats, are buying one-way tickets home.

One idea from Apple could put up more of a roadblock. Published on Tuesday by the US Patent and Trademark Office, an Apple patent called \"Driver handheld computing device lock-out\" proposes a couple of different ways to cut off texting and other cell phone features while you're driving. In one scenario, Apple's technology would work on its own by detecting the motion of the driver and/or analyzing the surrounding scenery. The motion detector would use the phone's onboard sensors to tell if the car is moving beyond a certain speed. The scenery analyzer would use the phone's camera to determine if the phone is being held by the driver. If a red flag goes up, a lock-out mechanism would then automatically disable texting and other functions of the phone. In a second scenario, your car would essentially tell your phone when it's time to be quiet. After you start your car, your ignition key would send a signal to your phone to disable texting and other features. The first scenario sounds more complicated but may be more doable as it would rely solely on technology built into the phone. The second scenario sounds simpler but would require the involvement of automakers. ][...] http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-aims-to-disable-texting-while-youre-driving/ Lots more on the web, enter Google: \" stop drivers texting signal block \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4.2"}]}

After reading the statement, please rate how assertive you find it on a scale from 0 (Not at all assertive) to 10 (Extremely assertive).\n\nAssertiveness refers to how strongly and confidently the statement presents its arguments.

For example, a statement that says, \u2018This is certainly the case\u2019 would be more assertive than one that says, \u2018This might be the case.\u2019\n\nPlease be consistent in your ratings. A \u20180\u2019 should reflect language that is hesitant, uncertain, or non-committal, while a \u201810\u2019 should reflect language that is confident, decisive, and leaves no room for doubt.

Perhaps people might want to consider changing the principles of the Constitution. But dragging the Constitution into into party politics is not the way to begin the discussion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3.4"}]}
