# Mechanistic interpretability on Llama 3 9B model for Assertiveness

- This directory contains the source code for the mechanistic interpretability of the Llama 3 9B model for Assertiveness.

- The experiments are done in liar_dataset/liar_pei.ipynb in order to understand the model's behavior and the features it uses to make its responses more or less assertive.
