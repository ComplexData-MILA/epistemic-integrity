Experiment8 is where we do the analysis of which assertivity measurements are the best when tested on the annotated Pei dataset.
Experiment9 is where we calculate assertivity calibration by using the certainty measurement and comparing it with the assertivity measurement. The dataset is LIAR, but with explanations.
